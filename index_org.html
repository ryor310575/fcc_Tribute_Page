          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
              "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
              in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
              how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
              Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
              laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
              returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
              Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
              work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
              other applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
              leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
              pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
              different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
              varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
              season, doubling wheat yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
              with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
              well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
              strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
              mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
            </li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
              increase their maize and sorghum yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
              University
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
              supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
              we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
              are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
              plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
              people were selecting the best breeds."
            </li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

          Build a Tribute Page

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

User Story #3: I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

You can build your project by using this CodePen template and clicking Save to create your own pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js.

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
